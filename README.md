# Avans_PokeBattles
This is our project for the computer science 2.1 semester assignment of C#.

## What is this repo?
This repository is a small game based on the concept of Pokemon Showdown. We wanted to make an application based on this concept and without the need for a browser.

## The concept
This game is a turn based Pokemon game where you battle using a Pokemons moves to deal damage and faint the Pokemon of the opponent. If all Pokemon of your opponents have fainted, you have won the game.
